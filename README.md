# First Game

> I have no idea what I'm doing. 

Trying to learn some C++ and some Graphics programming froms scratch. 

## Build and run 

Just your typical CMake routine after cloning this onto your machine. I'm developing on 
macos with an M1 chip. 

```bash
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake ..
make 
./HelloWorld
```
